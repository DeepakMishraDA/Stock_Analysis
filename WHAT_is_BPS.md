#### BPS of 78 or 50 
```Capital employed in BPS refers to the amount of capital invested in a business process outsourcing (BPO) company, typically measured in basis points (BPS). BPS is a unit of measure commonly used in finance that represents 1/100th of a percentage point.

Capital employed in BPS can be calculated by dividing the total capital employed by the company by its revenue, and then multiplying the result by 10,000 to express it in basis points. This measure is often used to evaluate the efficiency of a BPO company in generating revenue relative to the amount of capital invested in the business.

For example, if a BPO company has total capital employed of $10 million and generates revenue of $20 million, its capital employed in BPS would be calculated as follows:

Capital employed in BPS = (Total capital employed / Revenue) x 10,000
Capital employed in BPS = ($10,000,000 / $20,000,000) x 10,000
Capital employed in BPS = 50 BPS

This means that for every $1 of capital employed in the BPO company, it generates 0.5 cents of revenue, or 50 basis points. The higher the capital employed in BPS, the more efficient the BPO company is in generating revenue relative to its capital investment.
