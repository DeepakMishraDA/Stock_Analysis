**A balance sheet is a financial statement that shows a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. The main purpose of a balance sheet is to provide a snapshot of a company's financial position, which can be useful for assessing the company's overall health and ability to meet its financial obligations.**

###  Main components of a balance sheet:

#### Assets:
```
These are the resources that a company owns or controls and that have economic value. Assets can be categorized as current assets or non-current assets.
Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within a year. Examples include cash,[accounts receivable, and inventory](https://github.com/DeepakMishraDA/Stock_Analysis/blob/master/AccR_Inventory.md).
Non-current assets are assets that are expected to provide economic value for more than one year. Examples include property, plant, and equipment, and long-term investments.
```
#### Liabilities: 
```
These are the obligations that a company owes to others. Liabilities can also be categorized as current liabilities or non-current liabilities.
Current liabilities are obligations that are due within a year. Examples include accounts payable, short-term loans, and current portion of long-term debt.
Non-current liabilities are obligations that are not due within a year. Examples include long-term loans, deferred tax liabilities, and pension obligations.
```
#### Equity: 
```
This is the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting its liabilities. Equity can be categorized as common equity or preferred equity.
Common equity represents the ownership interest of the company's common stockholders.
Preferred equity represents the ownership interest of the company's preferred stockholders.
