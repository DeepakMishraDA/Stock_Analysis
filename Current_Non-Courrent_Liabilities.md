Liabilities are the obligations or debts that a company owes to others, which are expected to be settled in the future. There are two main categories of liabilities: current liabilities and non-current liabilities.

Current liabilities are short-term debts or obligations that are due within one year or within the normal operating cycle of a company, whichever is longer. They are expected to be settled by using current assets or through the creation of other current liabilities. Examples of current liabilities include:

#### Accounts payable: 
This is the amount owed by a company to its suppliers for goods or services received but not yet paid for. It includes items such as raw materials, finished goods, and services.

#### Accrued expenses: 
These are expenses that have been incurred by a company but have not yet been paid for, such as salaries and wages, rent, interest, and taxes.

Short-term loans: These are loans that are due within one year, such as bank loans, lines of credit, and commercial paper.

Current maturities of long-term debt: These are the portions of long-term debt that are due within one year, such as a mortgage payment or the principal portion of a long-term loan.

Non-current liabilities are long-term debts or obligations that are not due within one year or the normal operating cycle of a company, whichever is longer. They are expected to be settled over a period of time greater than one year. Examples of non-current liabilities include:

Long-term debt: This includes loans, bonds, and other debt that are due in more than one year. They are typically used to finance capital expenditures or other long-term investments.

### Deferred tax liabilities: 
These are tax liabilities that are due in the future due to temporary differences between book and tax accounting, such as depreciation or inventory valuation.

Pension liabilities: These are obligations to pay future retirement benefits to employees.

Lease liabilities: These are obligations to make future lease payments under operating or finance leases.

It is important for a company to understand its current and non-current liabilities as they can affect its financial health and ability to operate. Understanding the nature and timing of these liabilities is crucial for financial planning and management.
